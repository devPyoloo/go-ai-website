Human Motion & Behavior Analysis
This system uses real-time video processing to track and classify human movements, providing insights into dynamic physical actions.

Key Features:
✔ Full-Body Motion Tracking – Detects arms, legs, and torso positions with pose estimation.
✔ Behavior Classification – Identifies actions (throwing, kicking, reaching, stepping) and motion patterns.
✔ Visual Feedback – Overlays motion trails and real-time analytics on video.


Rotation Counter
This automated system detects and counts rotations of power tools (like drills) in real-time video footage using YOLOv8 object detection.

Key Features:
✔ Precision Counting - Tracks each full rotation with configurable sensitivity
✔ Visual Feedback - Annotated video output with real-time counter overlay
✔ Delay Control - Smart detection avoids double-counting with adjustable timing


AI Gauge Measurement System
Automatically reads and records values from analog gauges (pressure, torque, etc.) in real-time video streams with visual verification.

Key Features:
✔ Multi-Gauge Detection - Identifies different gauge types (pressure, torque, drill rotation)
✔ Precision Measurement - Converts needle position to accurate digital readings
✔ Data Logging - Exports timestamped readings to Excel with process documentation
